It took me exactly 1 week. | I like the section under Value, it's well written. On The Community guidelines section, what is the difference between "Be welcoming ... and Be inclusive?" Also, some of the points are strongly opinionated. I suggest you consider using a more informative language on such ethical topics. Stating CHAOSS standards against community expectations.
