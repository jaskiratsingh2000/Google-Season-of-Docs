## Community Bonding Week-8 Summary
> I worked on the "General FAQ" in this week.

### Day 1
* After making a fair research about the General faq that needs to be written under the section, I started writing about it in the GitBook.
* Wrote about - What is CHAOSS? What does CHAOSS stand for? What is the metric? Why does Community Health matter? What does Community Health mean?

### Day 2
* Wrote about - How do I get involved? How do I use your software? Is my open source community healthy? How can I assess the health of my community?

### Day 3
* Researched on What metric can help me to assess the health of my community? But couldnâ€™t find that
* Wrote about - How do I get involved? How do I use your software? Is my open source community healthy? How can I assess the health of my community?

### Day 4
* Wrote about - Where can I find the relevant metric I am looking for? What is D&I badging? Does CHAOSS provide any tools to measure the open source project or community health? Who are the maintainers of the CHAOSS? Whom should I contact if I have any questions? Does CHAOSS record their meeting?

### Day 5-6
