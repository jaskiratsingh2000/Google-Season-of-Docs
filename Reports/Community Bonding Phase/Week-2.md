## Community Bonding Week-2 Summary
> I was supposed to understand and research around CHAOSS Working Groups. It was fun doing a research and understanding the methodologies of various groups

### Day 1
* Worked on the inconsistencies and the inputs received from Georg and Matt on the mailing list regarding the Values and documented same within the GitBook
* Did research :+1: on the “**Working Groups**”. Tried to understand their vision and motives. Came across some questions:  
  * How to define any new focus area of metrics inside any working group?
  * What is the workflow and culture inside the working groups?
  * What criteria do the Working groups follow for refining or accepting any metric under the relevant group?
* Started a thread on the CHAOSS community mailing list with a subject: “*Understanding Working Groups better - context for Community Handbook*“ :rocket:

### Day 2
* Understanding the Working Groups
* Research :pencil2: on the content that needs to be added for the community handbook
